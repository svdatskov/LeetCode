# You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].
#
# Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions. If no such pair of indices exists, return -1.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
# Output: 54
# Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
# - (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
# - (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
# So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
# Output: -1
# Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 109
