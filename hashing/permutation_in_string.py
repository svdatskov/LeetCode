# Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.
#
# In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
# Output: true
# Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
# Example 2:
#
# Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
# Output: false
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
# s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
