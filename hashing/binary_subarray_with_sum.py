# Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.
#
# A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
# [1,0,1,0,1]
# [1,0,1,0,1]
# [1,0,1,0,1]
# [1,0,1,0,1]
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
# Output: 15
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
# 0 <= goal <= nums.length
