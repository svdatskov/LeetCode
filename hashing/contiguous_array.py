# Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [0,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [0,1,0]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 105
# nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
